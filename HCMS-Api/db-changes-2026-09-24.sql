-- "My Approvals - Documents": the Approved and Reverted/Rejected tabs listed a document once per
-- approval instead of once per document, so a document approved at creation and again at revision
-- appeared twice with every visible column identical. Pending is unchanged -- each waiting step is
-- its own action item.
--
-- Safe to re-run. Replaces the function only; no table or data is touched.
